# Etch-a-Sketch

This is yet another project that showcases abilities in Javascript DOM manipulation, the page itself and its style is quite simple, with the page script being the main showcased aspect, though it isn't too complex either.

In this page you can hover your mouse on the grid displayed on the page, which will create a pixelated trail of your mouse path; you can also clear the grid if you want to, change the grid size to a maximum of 64x64 pixels, change the color of the trail (default value is black) or activate rainbow mode, which will generate a random RGB value for each square you hover through. The grid itself is made with a flexbox and various squared divs inside of it, which are all Javascript-generated.

This was quite a nice project to work on, and it taught me quite a bit about Javascript and how DOM manipulation works in more detail.
