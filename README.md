# Etch-a-Sketch

This is yet another project that showcases my abilities in Javascript DOM manipulation, the page itself and its style is simple, with the page script being the main showcased aspect, though it isn't too complex either.

In this page you can hover your mouse on the grid displayed on the page, which will create a pixelated black trail of your mouse path; you can also clear the grid if you want to, or change the grid size to a maximum of 64x64 pixels. The grid itself is made with a flexbox and various squared divs inside of it, which are all Javascript-generated.

This project is still in W.I.P phase, and by the end of it you should be able to change the color of the trail, as well as some other coloring options.
